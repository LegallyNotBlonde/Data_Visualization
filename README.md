In this project, I analyzed data from a recent animal study involving 249 mice with SCC tumors. These mice were treated with various drug regimens for 45 days, during which we observed and measured tumor development to compare the effectiveness of a specific drug against other treatments.


Some key insights from our analysis:


Summary statistics across all 10 drugs analyzed indicated that Capomulin and Ramicane demonstrated the smallest tumor sizes among the mice, priving to have the best potential.

The line graph illustrating the number of observed mouse timepoints and treatments revealed that a majority of mice received Capomulin and Ramicane treatments, suggesting these two drugs were extensively researched. In contrast, the least number of mice were treated with Propriva.

The study had a balanced representation of both sexes, with approximately equal percentages of male and female mice (51% and 49%, respectively). This balanced representation ensures that the results are well-studied for both sexes.

While Capomulin treatment resulted in smaller tumor sizes compared to other drugs by the end of the observation period, the line graph for mouse ID l509 indicated temporary improvements followed by periods of tumor growth. This suggests that Capomulin may require more time to exhibit consistent effectiveness.

A notable correlation of 0.84 was observed between tumor size and mouse weight, indicating that higher mouse weight is associated with larger tumor sizes.

A recommendation for Capomulin producers would be to continue refining the treatment to achieve consistent improvements over time. While Ramicane also showed promise, further enhancements are needed to enhance its effectiveness in reducing tumor size compared to Capomulin, which appears more effective at present.
